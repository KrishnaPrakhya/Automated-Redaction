## What is Redaction?
Redaction means hiding private or sensitive information—like names, numbers, or secrets—while keeping the rest of the data usable. Think of it as blacking out parts of a page so no one can peek at what’s underneath. This tool makes this process secure and effortless.

---

## Features
- **Context-Aware Redaction**: Uses BERT and Gliner Model models to understand and redact data intelligently.
- **Strong Security**: Implements TLS encryption to keep your data safe.
- **Flexible Controls**: Customize how you redact data to fit your needs.
- **Realistic Data Anonymization**: Creates synthetic data that looks real but keeps your information private.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Works seamlessly online or offline with a simple design.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrishnaPrakhya/Automated-Redaction.git
   cd Automated-Redaction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials). Refer to `.env.example` if available.

4. **Run the Development Server**  
   Start the Next.js app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

5. **Run the Backend Server** (if applicable)  
   Navigate to the `server/` directory and follow any additional setup instructions there.

## Usage
1. **Access the App**: Open the app in your browser after starting the development server.
2. **Upload a Document**: Use the web interface to upload a file (text, PDF, etc.) you want to redact.
3. **Redact Data**: The tool will automatically detect and hide sensitive information, or you can customize the redaction settings.
4. **Download the Result**: Save the redacted file securely as a PDF or other supported format.
